    <h2>Case Study Overview</h2>
    <p>
      As the <strong>Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</strong> of a local restaurant, my objective was to support the restaurant’s
      <strong>digital transformation</strong> by designing and developing a web-based solution that enhances customer engagement,
      modernizes communication, and streamlines the table booking process.
    </p>

    <p>
      The restaurant had been relying on manual phone bookings and walk-in management, which led to inefficiencies, limited marketing reach,
      and missed opportunities for customer feedback. To address these challenges, I led the design of an interactive online platform —
      a central digital hub where customers can <strong>book tables, send feedback, and connect via social media</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve customer engagement and loyalty through digital channels.</li>
      <li>Enable seamless online table reservations and customer feedback collection.</li>
      <li>Integrate the restaurant’s web presence with major social media platforms.</li>
      <li>Provide customers with quick access to contact information and promotions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digital Solution Features</h2>
    <p>
      The developed website integrates key digital tools for communication and marketing. Its responsive design ensures accessibility across devices,
      and the interactive form (below) demonstrates how customers can submit a booking or feedback request directly via email —
      without requiring a live database connection.
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Booking & Feedback Form</h3>
    <form onsubmit="sendEmail(event)">
      <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
      <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
      <textarea id="message" rows="5" placeholder="Enter your booking details or feedback..." required></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Send Email</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Design Concept & Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      The page design prioritizes <strong>clarity, usability, and real-world functionality</strong>. By keeping the layout clean and the form interaction simple,
      the solution provides a tangible demonstration of how digital technologies can modernize traditional restaurant operations.
      The “mailto” integration enables instant communication through the user’s email client — a lightweight yet effective method for small businesses
      transitioning into digital systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      This design concept mirrors the broader philosophy of <strong>digital transformation strategy</strong> — using accessible, scalable web tools
      to deliver measurable value quickly, while laying a foundation for future upgrades such as real-time booking systems, CRM integration,
      and analytics dashboards.
